# Percolation Emergence Demo

### *This is a branch to temporarily modify initial starting conditions. It will be merged into main / become obsolete once the main branch implements a way to modify initial conditons cleanly.*

This is a (very) simple demo to simulate critical behaviour in a simple percolation model.
